# Make-it-simpler
Meet your programming language in the right way.

# Idea
The idea is to create a repository for any programming language and inside create a lesson for learners who want to have to use all power of one language, and make their code simpler. 

# Example: 

--Make it Simpler

  -/ JavaScript
  
    -/ Lesson 01
    
      -/ start
      
        -/ index.js //example code 
        
        -/ description.txt //why is this on that way
        
      -/ finish
      
        -/ index.js //how code shoud look after tut
        
        -/ final.txt // optional
